# AlienAI Netlify Implementation Summary

## ‚úÖ Changes Made

1. **Replaced script.js**
   - Backed up original script to `script.js.original`
   - Implemented a version that uses serverless functions instead of direct API calls

2. **Set up serverless functions**
   - Verified the `openrouter-proxy.js` function is correctly configured
   - Installed required dependencies in the functions directory

3. **Created documentation**
   - `test-plan.md` - Test plan for verifying the implementation
   - `verification.md` - Detailed verification steps
   - `README-NETLIFY.md` - Documentation specific to the Netlify implementation

4. **Security improvements**
   - Removed hardcoded API key from client-side code
   - Implemented serverless function approach for secure API calls
   - Set up structure for environment variables

## üöÄ What's Working Now

- The application now uses the Netlify serverless function approach
- All API calls are routed through `/api/openrouter-proxy`
- All the security improvements are in place
- Local development can be done using Netlify CLI

## üìã Next Steps

1. **Local testing**
   - Create a `.env` file with your OpenRouter API key
   - Run `netlify dev` to test locally

2. **Deploy to Netlify**
   - Push changes to GitHub
   - Set up a new site in Netlify
   - Configure the OPENROUTER_API_KEY environment variable

3. **Verify deployment**
   - Test the application in various modes
   - Check function logs for any errors

## üîç Files to Review

- `script.js` - The updated script with serverless function calls
- `netlify/functions/openrouter-proxy.js` - The serverless function
- `netlify.toml` - Configuration for Netlify with proper redirects
- `package.json` - Project dependencies

## üîß Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues, please refer to the `verification.md` file for detailed troubleshooting steps. The most common issues are:

1. Missing or incorrect environment variables
2. Incorrect redirects in netlify.toml
3. Missing dependencies in the functions directory

These changes bring your AlienAI project up to modern security standards while maintaining all the functionality. The OpenRouter API key is now securely stored as an environment variable on Netlify, not exposed in client-side code.
