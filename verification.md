# AlienAI Netlify API Implementation Verification

## What Has Been Done
1. ✅ Replaced script.js with a version that uses serverless functions instead of direct API calls
2. ✅ Verified the openrouter-proxy.js serverless function is properly configured
3. ✅ Confirmed package.json has the necessary dependencies

## What This Changes
1. **Security**: Your OpenRouter API key is now managed securely through Netlify environment variables instead of being hardcoded in client-side code
2. **Maintainability**: API keys can be changed without modifying code
3. **User Experience**: The application works the same as before, but with better security practices

## How To Test

### Local Testing
1. Install Netlify CLI if you haven't already:
   ```
   npm install -g netlify-cli
   ```

2. Install function dependencies:
   ```
   cd netlify/functions
   npm install
   cd ../..
   ```

3. Create a .env file with your API key for local testing:
   ```
   echo "OPENROUTER_API_KEY=your_api_key_here" > .env
   ```

4. Start local development server:
   ```
   netlify dev
   ```

5. Open your browser and test the application

### Netlify Deployment
1. Push changes to your GitHub repository
2. Connect your repository to Netlify
3. Set up the OPENROUTER_API_KEY environment variable in Netlify:
   - Go to Site settings > Environment variables
   - Add a new variable with key OPENROUTER_API_KEY and your API key as the value

## Troubleshooting
- If you encounter "API key not configured" errors, check that your environment variable is set correctly
- If you see "404 Not Found" errors for /api/openrouter-proxy, make sure the netlify.toml file has the proper redirects
- To view function logs in Netlify, go to Functions > openrouter-proxy > View Logs

## Confirming Success
Once deployed, your application should work exactly as before, but now with:
- No API key visible in client-side code
- API requests going through serverless functions
- API key securely stored in Netlify's environment variables
